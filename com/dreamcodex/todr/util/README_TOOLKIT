TOD Toolkit v1.1 (C)2004-2008 Howard Kistler/Dream Codex (www.dreamcodex.com)
Utility classes for working with Tunnels Of Doom game files.

HOW TO USE THE TOOLKIT
--------------------------

The TOD Toolkit contains two main classes:

TODparser - Extracts game data from TOD game files.
TODimager - Extracts image data from TOD game files.

It also includes the assistant class TI99FileFinder, which locates files in
TI-99/4A disk images.

The toolkit can be conveniently run using either included shell script.
On Unix/Linux systems, use the todproc.sh script.
On Windows systems, use the todproc.bat script.
Both take the same arguments, as shown here:

	todproc DISKIMAGE FILENAME DATAOUT [IMAGEPREFIX]

The arguments are:

DISKIMAGE   - TI-99/4A disk image file containing the TOD game file (include path to disk file if necessary).
FILENAME    - The name of the game file on the disk image.
DATAOUT     - The name of the file to save the parsed data to.
IMAGEPREFIX - Optional prefix to attach to image files (can include path data, if left blank will be same as FILENAME).

Here's are two examples:

	todproc.bat Tunnels.dsk PENNIES output.txt

This will extract the data and images from the TOD "PENNIES" adventure on the "Tunnels.dsk" disk image.
It will save the data to a file named "output.txt", and the images will be named starting with the label "PENNIES".

	todproc.bat Tunnels.dsk QUEST dump/questdata.txt dump/images/saved

This will extract the data and images from the TOD "QUEST" adventure on the "Tunnels.dsk" disk image.
It will save the data to a file named "questdata.txt" in the "dump" directory (relatively located to the current directory),
and the images will go into the "dump/images" subdirectory, with the label "saved" applied to the beginning of each image name.

(To use the Unix/Linux version of the script, simply replace "todproc.bat" with "./todproc.sh")
